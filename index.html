            <h1>The Eye of the World</h1>
            <img src="eye-of-the-world.jpg" class="responsive__image" alt="The Eye of the World">
            <p>The first book in The Wheel of Time series is the book "The Eye of the World". As the first main line book of the series, it introduces the reader to the world in which it takes place. The main characters are Rand al'Thor, Perrin Aybara, Nynaeve al'Meara, Egwene al'Vere and Matrim Cauthon, whose names gets shortened to Mat in the series. The residence of Emond's Field is attacked by Trollocs, the most basic of soldiers of the antagonist faction in the series, alongside their commanders the Myrddraal.
            As these soldiers are after the protagonists, they end up feeling the village, to make sure that Emond's Field does not get further ravaged by the Trollocs and Myrddraal. They are aided in their escape by people that become major supporting characters to the story: Moiraine Damodred, Al'Lan Mandragoran, and Thom Merrilin. They take refuge in a place called Shadar Logoth, known as an evil city.
            In Shadar Logoth, Mat gets posessed by an evil intelligence, called Mashadar. Shadar Logoth is used as the stage to seperate the characters from each other, eventually allowing each character to reach a place called Caemlyn. Rand, Mat and Thom travel by boat to Whitebridge, where Tom is left behind to shake off enemies, allowing Rand and Mat to escape.
            Rand meets an Ogier named Loial in Caemlyn. Rand also befriends Elayne, who is the heir to one of the major kingdoms in their world, Andor. Rand is pronounced to be the Dragon Reborn; the one who is the Warrior of the Light, to fight the Dark One, as foretold by certain prophecies.
            The prophecy is not positive, however; as the Dragon is said to be just as likely to destroy the world as save it.
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, Perrin and Egwene are guided to Caemlyn by Elyas Machera. Elyas is a Wolfbrother; someone who can communicate with wolves telephatically, and it turns out that Perrin holds the same power. They run into the Children of the Light, and Perrin kills two members of this faction due to them killing a wolf.
            The Children of the Light sentence Perrin to death, although they get saved by Moiraine, Lan and Nynaeve before this happens. They reunite with Rand and Mat in Caemlyn afterwards, and the group travels to Tar Valon; the center of power of the Aes Sedai. Aes Sedai are people that are able to use "The Power", which after the Breaking of the World can only be used by women. Men using the power will go insane, as the male counterpart of the Power has been tainted by the Dark One during the Breaking.
           </p>
           <p>The Ogier Loial warns Moiraine that the Eye of the World is being threatened; this is one of the only pools of Saidin (the Power) left untainted by the Dark One. This Eye is guarded by a being called the Green Man. The group travels to the Blight, which is a polluted region under control of the Dark One, and they meet the Green Man.
            The group is encountered by the Forsaken, servants to the Dark One. The Green Man slays one of the Forsaken, Balthamel, and is slain himself. Rand ends up defeating the other Forsaken, Aginor, and uses the Eye of the World to destroy the army of Trollocs, and defeat Ba'Alzamon, another Forsaken. Rand using the Eye of the World confirms him as the Dragon Reborn; the new Warrior of Light. </p>
