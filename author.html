			Jordan has served two tours in Vietnam (1968 to 1970) with the United States Army as a helicopter gunner.
			He was awarded with the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with "V" and oak leaf cluster and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm. After serving in Vietnam he attended the Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, where he received an undergraduate degree in physics.
			After graduating, he was employed by the United States Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in 1977. Jordan was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis on March 23, 2006. He began chemotherapy treat at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in early April 2016.
			Jordan died on September 16, 2007, and his funeral service was held on September 19, 2007. Jordan was cremated and his ashes buried in the churchyard of St. James Church in Goose Creek, outside Charleston, South Carolina.

			<p>Jordan is best known for the Wheel of Time series, which comprises 14 books and a prequel novel. Jordan wrote the first 12 books, including the prequel novel. After his death, his widow Harriet McDougal and his publisher Tom Doherty chose Brandson Sanderson to continue the twelfth book in the series The Wheel of Time.
			The last three books of the serie are part of Jordan's projected final book. All the three books are written by Sanderson with the aid of extensive notes left by the late Jordan.
			Jordan is also one of the several writers to have written the original Conan the Barbarian novels. The ones he wrote are highly acclaimed to this day.
