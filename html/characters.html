            <p>Perrin is the second of the three central main characters. He is one of the Wolfbrothers; people that are able to telephatically communicate with wolves. One of the aspects of being a Wolfbrother is that they develop genetically to become
                similar to wolves as well. Due to his power as a Wolfbrother, he is greatly skilled in manipulating the world of dreams, Tel'aran'rhiod. Perrin is married to Faile ni Bashere t'Aybara, who is an apparent heir to Saldaea's vacant throne.
                Perrin was unofficialy known as the Lord of the Two Rivers, as he aided greatly in the defence of the region. Rand al'Thor later bestowed the title of Lord Steward of the Dragon in the Two Rivers to Perrin Aybara, making his title official.
