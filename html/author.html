                James Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 – September 16, 2007), better known by his pen name Robert Jordan, was born in Charleston, South Carolina. Jordan has served two tours in Vietnam (1968 to 1970) with the United States Army as a helicopter gunner.
                He was awarded with the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with "V" and oak leaf cluster and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm. After serving in Vietnam he attended the Citadel, The Military College
                of South Carolina, where he received an undergraduate degree in physics. After graduating, he was employed by the United States Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in 1977. Jordan was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis on March
                23, 2006. He began chemotherapy treat at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in early April 2016. Jordan died on September 16, 2007, and his funeral service was held on September 19, 2007. Jordan was cremated and his ashes buried
                in the churchyard of St. James Church in Goose Creek, outside Charleston, South Carolina.

            <p>
                Jordan is best known for the Wheel of Time series, which comprises 14 books and a prequel novel. Jordan wrote the first 12 books, including the prequel novel. After his death, his widow Harriet McDougal and his publisher Tom Doherty chose Brandson Sanderson
                to continue the twelfth book in the series The Wheel of Time. The last three books of the serie are part of Jordan's projected final book. All the three books are written by Sanderson with the aid of extensive notes left by the late Jordan.
                Jordan is also one of the several writers to have written the original Conan the Barbarian novels. The ones he wrote are highly acclaimed to this day.

            <h2>Brandon Sanderson</h2>

            <p>
                Brandon Sanderson (December 19, 1975), was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. Sanderson became a passionate reader of high fantasy novels while a teenager, and he made several early attempts at writing his own stories. After graduating from high school in 1994,
                he matriculated at Brigham Young University (BYU) as a biochemistry major. He took a two-year leave of absence from 1995 to 1997 to serve as a volunteer full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was assigned
                to serve in South Korea. After completing his missionary service, Sanderson returned to BYU and changed his major to English literature. While an undergraduate, Sanderson took a job as a night desk clerk at a local hotel in Provo, Utah,
                as it allowed him to write while working. Sanderson wrote consistently throughout his undergraduate and graduate studies, and by 2003 he had written twelve novels, all unpublished. While in the middle of a graduate program at BYU, Tor
                Books editor Moshe Feder contacted him to say that he wanted to acquire one of his books. Sanderson had submitted the manuscript of his sixth novel, Elantris, a year and a half earlier. Elantris was published by Tor Books on April 21,
                2005, to generally positive reviews.
            </p>
            <p>This was followed in 2006 by Mistborn: The Final Empire, the first book in his Mistborn fantasy trilogy, in which "allomancers"—people with the ability to ‘burn’ metals and alloys after ingesting them—gain enhanced senses and control over
                powerful supernatural forces. Jordan is best known for the fantasy novels that he wrote that take place in the Cosmere universe. This idea came from Sanderson's desire to create an epic length series without requiring readers to buy a
                ridiculous number of books. Because of that, he hides connections to his other works within each book, creating this "hidden epic". He has estimated that the Cosmere sequence could conclude with at least 40 books. He is also known for
                finishing Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time.
